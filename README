This is library loads lines of text in a simple attr=value format into
arbitrary Go data structures, and encodes Go data structures into
lines of text in the same format. The format is inspired by the Plan 9
network database format, seen here:

http://plan9.bell-labs.com/magic/man2html/6/ndb

The format is the same, except that values may be quoted with single
quotes to contain white space. The package can be installed with 
	
	`go get aqwari.net/exp/ndb`

Once installed, documentation can be viewed with the godoc tool.
